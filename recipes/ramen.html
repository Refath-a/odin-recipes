    <h2>Description</h2> 
    <p>Naruto ramen, dattebayo!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Packages of Top Ramen</li>
        <li>About 5 cups of pork or beef broth (You can use the stuff in a box, the stuff in a can, or the cubes or the paste)</li>
        <li>Pork tenderloin</li>
        <li>2 Eggs</li>
        <li>1 Baby bok choy</li>
        <li>1 Green onion</li>
        <li>Soy sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Marinate the tenderloin for at least 3 hours.  You can use just soy sauce, or a mixure of whatever other Asian sauces you want.  Teriyaki would be good, as would some mirin.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 450, then cook the tenderloin for 12-15 minutes, or until cooked all the way through.</li>
        <li>Put your eggs in a pot with enough water to cover them.  Bring to a boil and cover with a lid.  It should take about 10 minutes to hard boil the eggs.  Then pull them out and put them into a bowl of cold water to cool.
        </li>
        <li>While this is happening, pour or mix the stock/broth in a pot and bring it to a simmer.  You can add soy sauce or mirin to taste.
        </li>
        <li>Once simmering, add the Top Ramen noodles.  Do NOT add in the flavor packets.  Let that cook.
        </li>
        <li>Now, we cut up all the toppings!  Peel the eggs and slice them in half, cut the pork,  kamaboko, bok choy, aburage, and green onion into thin slices.
        </li>
        <li>Serve up the noodles and broth in a nice deep bowl, then place all the ingredients in groups on top, and add in a few small rectangles of nori.  Itadakimasu!
        </li>
    </ol>
